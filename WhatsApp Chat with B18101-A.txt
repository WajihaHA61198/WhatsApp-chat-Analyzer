4/7/20, 14:55 - Amaan Cr: our first properly documented assignment with each lecture note.
4/13/20, 16:21 - Amaan Cr: Hello there fellow mates!
I want you all to visit the course i uploaded on YouTube, currently you would have been studying assembly language under miss urooj, if it wasn't for thr pandemic!

Even if studying does not sound appealing but if things went out normal uni will be opened in june and exams would be set after 3-4 weeks, assembly is different from other programming language it needs more practice and requires more efforts for the brain to accept.

Even if you watch one video each day and practice a little you would be well-prepared, and it would not be boring a guarantee that! 
Assembly language seems hard but its addictive and fun, and as CS students its what we do!
I Mean We Code!

So please visit this course: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrb70iTVZjZNSfBMQzywQ58E3IHtQqXZa

And this is the only course available ON 16-BIT ASSEMBLY PROGRAMMING.

Im also uploading automata, visual studio, firebase database, software engineering tutorials so checked them out too...

Subscribe to support me, there are not much tech YouTubers in Pakistan & i want to change that.

Thanks for reading

9/10/20, 01:28 - AJ: Kindly our class. Join in the protest on 15th September outside admin block. 90% departments mai toh masle hain. Hamare bhi oop aur discrete ke ilawah hain masle. Linear ki maam never taught us, semiconductor wale sir closed the chat and no one could even speak. Dld miss se half satisfied. Because she uploaded video lectures but then one to one nahi hua contact, which was fine for open book exams BUT not physical exam. And then comes assembly, maybe half satisfied. All in all there was no issue until we thought that online exams honge ya ham assignment base pe promote krdiye jainge as discrete maam said.

According to the education ministry, the facility has been introduced in order to facilitate the students looking for educational opportunities.

With the provision of this facility, the students will have the choice to select a suitable option among different scholarships donors for the same program.
1/22/21, 22:09 - Bisma Cr: For the Students of *your Class* paper of BSCS 404 is scheduled on 04-02-2021 which will be of 40 Marks and of less than 2 hour duration.
Students of your class would be assessed for the other 60 marks which includes your lab / practical work marks too, through online assessment methods.
Marks distribution of 40+20 (Practical/Lab work) would be communicated later, as this would majorly be assessed through class participation of students/ their class responses and Online Submission task that would be assigned later (till 15 February).

This mark distribution policy is not for the students that are not part of your class (Repeaters/Improvers).

I would register Repeaters / Improvers on Exam date before the paper, providing that students have valid admit card for appearing in paper, and will conduct their oral/ viva for the other marks physically if they have power or internet connection issues the same day.

Students who would be unable to attend paper on the dates and time mentioned due to any unavoidable condition related to their health issue would be dealt as per clause 3 of the notification issued by University Registrar.

6/28/21, 00:04 - Bisma Cr: Dear Students
I hope all of you would be safe and healthy by the blessing of Allah.
I wish all my beloved students very good luck for the examinations - and pray for their bright success in all walks of life.
The current semester has been completely disturbed, ruined and destroyed due to the pandemic situation. But, there is no need to panic, everyone around is suffered the same way globally.
Examinations time is here - BUT, unfortunately, due to the continued pandemic situation, the current semester has also been completely disturbed, ruined and destroyed. Furthermore, my severe illness has played another important role in that. But, there is no need to panic, everyone around is suffered by the global pandemic crisis equally.
Adding to that, I really missed being with my students in the classroom during the semester. It has been unfortunate to me that I could not share whatever my knowledge is with my prestigious student due to REASONS, especially my illness.
I am more concerned about what to do than you would have been. BUT, don't worry - I AM, AND WILL ALWAYS REMAIN WITH YOU IN THE DIFFICULT TIME - FOR YOU - TO MAKE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE. Hence, I assure you, that there is no need to worry. The things will go in your favour, InShaAllah.
And, for the matter of examination, YOU MUST NOT BE WORRIED - I know what had happened during the semester - and BELIEVE ME, nobody will be examined for what has not been taught. I BELIEVE that my students are good enough to understand this - so they should come to the examination WITHOUT ANY WORRY OR TENSION.
We will be having the short examination (to be held physically, not online).
The topics for the examination would only be the introductory topic(s) - and you will NOT be having any difficulty, whatsoever.
Marks and time for the examination would not be as usual (may be not more than one hour).
There is absolutely no need to worry or panic. You might get better grades than your expected one.
The examination will be pleasingly surprising for you, InShaAllah. And, I know how to grade my worthy students. You would be pleased by the result too, InShaAllah.
Hence, prepare yourself for the examination - and keep strong belief in Allah - you will be receiving the BEST REWARDS, InShaAllah.
Meanwhile, I may try to share some stuff with the students through the Google Classroom for the course, if my health allows for the same. 
And, PLEASE do PRAY for my HEALTH and complete recovery; and for the health of everyone around us. That’s much needed indeed, especially these days.
JazaakAllah.
Best of luck, always!

Furthermore, I am extremely sorry for not being able to deliver the content in-class.
Please don't worry, and I assure you that there is no need to panic at all.
Best of luck for your exams, and for your future endeavour.
Be blessed, always.

(3) Add 3D helix to your scene with radius = last digit of seat/nic number
Constant b= 2nd last digit of seat/nic number
(4)Implement default camera movements on all 3 axis on keys 
(5)Implement a flyby (automode) of your scene. Camera moves automatically without colliding with objects in scene. This needs if else list according to object position. 
(6) Demonstrate an innovative use of parametric equations in same 3d scene

I hope this would find you in good health and as per the efforts you have put for the subject.
In case of any confusion about your marks in Assignment I would suggest you to re-check your assignment available on MS Team before raising the issue with me, obviously through CR. However In case you would be unable to find your mistake please contact me through your CR for a Slot of time (Preferably Online) to discuss it.
Secondly, any one willing to check his final term copy can also contact through CR and I will assign a date and time for the same.
I hope at this stage no one will come with excuses and requests to reconsider their marks for any reasons other than the above two issues.
